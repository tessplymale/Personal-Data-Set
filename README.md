# Personal-Data-Set

As an avid coffee drinker, I set out to find how often people drink coffee throughout the day. I broke it down by age to see how much it affects the decisions people make, as far as coffee consumption. It was difficult to find coffee consumption data. I had a lot of restrictions in place to ensure I only analyzed accurate, relevant sources to accuratly find results. Although the sources I did find, were filled with various studies and data points.

A large portion of the data was retrieved from the National Coffee Drinking Trends survey and questionnaire results in 2016. The data collected, was broken down into many sections analyzes the amount of coffee consumed by age, gender, etc. I used the coffee vs age data, as it best fit my motivating question. This data was directly from the NCA market research team. They explained how their research was gathered by defining terms so others understood their definition of coffee. The reserach was also compared from the years 2012, 2013, 2014,and 2015, they explained how the questions and responses differed in order to retrieve accurate information. 

After analyzing the data from my source, I then set up a table comparing the year, age group and amount of coffee consumed. The age groups I used were the same as listed within the data. I only looked at the years 2012, 2014 and 2016 to have a smaller, more condensed table that was a stronger representation of how things change over time with age. I avoided using any person under the age of 18 due to inconsistency with the amount of coffee consumption recorded. I also grouped ages 60+ together becuase that is where the coffee consumption seemed to steady out and plateau. 

I also analyzed a few other sources and breifly looked into their data sets. I created rough models from the data recorded to have a better understanding and higher accuracy of the results from the intial data set I analyzed.

This chart shows that as age increases, coffee consumption increases. However, there is a slight divot in the graph in 2016, 40-59 age category.
Notice, how strong the correlation is between each line plotted, as well as, how consistent and steady they continue to increase.

This chart explores a different source, but also shows that as age increases, caffine consumption increases. However, the caffine consumption slights deteriorates as the age reaches 65+.
Notice, how there is a trend of increase in the plotted points to show caffine consumption steadily increases with age.

Considering the amount of cups of coffee consumed within a period of time analysis resulted in a week correlation between variables.
As you can see, the amount of cups consumed does notice increase/decrease in a linear model. The variable results vary with as the amount of cups increase and decrease.

This chart analyzes the pounds of coffee consumed by continent. Europe has a significantly higher coffee consumption whereas Central America & Mexico have significantly smaller coffee consumptions.
Notice, how some countries have very similar amounts of coffee consumption.
