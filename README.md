# Personal Data Set

# Motivation
As an avid coffee drinker, I set out to find how often people drink coffee throughout the day. I broke it down by age to see how much it affects the decisions people make, as far as coffee consumption. It was difficult to find coffee consumption data. I had a lot of restrictions in place to ensure I only analyzed accurate, relevant sources to accuratly find results. Although the sources I did find, were filled with various studies and data points.

# Data Sources
A large portion of the data was retrieved from the [National Coffee Drinking Trends](http://michmerch.com/data/documents/National-Coffee-Drinking-Trends-2016-Market-Research-Reports.pdf) survey and questionnaire results in 2016. The data collected, was broken down into many sections analyzes the amount of coffee consumed by age, gender, etc. I used the coffee vs age data, as it best fit my motivating question. This data was directly from the NCA market research team. They explained how their research was gathered by defining terms so others understood their definition of coffee. The research was also compared from the years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, they explained how the questions and responses differed in order to retrieve accurate information. 

# Processing Steps
After analyzing the data from my source, I then set up a table comparing the year, age group and amount of coffee consumed. The age groups I used were the same as listed within the data. I only looked at the years 2012, 2014 and 2016 to have a smaller, more condensed table that was a stronger representation of how things change over time with age. I avoided using any person under the age of 18 due to inconsistency with the amount of coffee consumption recorded. I also grouped ages 60+ together becuase that is where the coffee consumption seemed to steady out and plateau. 

# Analysis
I used the linear correlation technique to analyze the responses in my data displayed on the chart. This allowed me to closely determine which elements correlated with each other and which did not. I learned that overall, my data has a strong, positive correlation. Each of the years (2012, 2014, 2016) all correlated postively with one another. Along with the year comparison, the age to coffee consumption percentage ratio was strong as well. I did notice a few outliers here and there that I would have missed without using this technique. This could also have been due to a survey error. By performing this analysis, I found an outlier in the coffee data from the age group of 40-59 in 2016. I noticed a trend that coffee consumption continued to increase as age increased. The data proved strong correlation between each of the age groups and years. I also used regressional analysis as an analysis technique. Similar to the linear correlation I analyzed how closely each of the responses were related. This allowed me to draw a similar conclusion to my previous analysis that the variable of age was related to the variable of coffee consumed.

This chart shows that as age increases, coffee consumption increases. However, there is a slight divot in the graph in 2016, 40-59 age category.
Notice, how strong the correlation is between each line plotted, as well as, how consistent and steady they continue to increase.

# Further Data Analysis and Processing on Various Sources
I also analyzed a few other sources and breifly looked into their data sets. I created rough models from the data recorded to have a better understanding and higher accuracy of the results from the intial data set I analyzed. The second source was directly from the [Caffine Informer](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-most-caffeinated-country) data base. The second data set analyzes caffine consumption rather than coffee consumption, but is very strongly related. Although this data set mainly focused on caffine consumption based on region, it did have recorded information regarding age and caffine consumption.  I only used age groups that were in similar groupings as my first data set for comparison purposes.

This chart explores a different source, but also shows that as age increases, caffine consumption increases. However, the caffine consumption slights deteriorates as the age reaches 65+.
Notice, how there is a trend of increase in the plotted points to show caffine consumption steadily increases with age.


For my third data set, I took data from the [CDC National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](http://www.ico.org/prices/new-consumption-table.pdf) from 2005. This survey had a variety of featured data regarding public health. My focal point was the amount of coffee consumed on a regular basis and how often people consumed coffee. I categorized the data into smaller groups for better analysis and chose the groups based on what I thought would make the most sense within the model, as well as what others could easily relate to.

Considering the amount of cups of coffee consumed within a period of time analysis resulted in a week correlation between variables.
As you can see, the amount of cups consumed does notice increase/decrease in a linear model. The variable results vary with as the amount of cups increase and decrease.

The next data set broke down the amount of pounds of coffee consumed by the continent. This data was very interesting to analyze as it provided more detail and imformation regarding the amount of coffee consumed throughout the world. For my third visualization, I took data from the [Information Commissioners Office](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2005-2006/FFQRAW_D.htm#FFQ0123) that upholds public interest and is an executive public body. Their information included coffee consumption data from all over the world, but I group it into continents for better analysis. I also converted the kilograms weight unit, to pounds.

This chart analyzes the pounds of coffee consumed by continent. Europe has a significantly higher coffee consumption whereas Central America & Mexico have significantly smaller coffee consumptions.
Notice, how some countries have very similar amounts of coffee consumption.
